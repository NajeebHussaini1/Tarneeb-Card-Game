    <h1>What is Tarneeb?  </h1>
    <p>
        Tarneeb is a Middle Eastern card game. <br />
        Tarneeb takes on the trick-taking card game. <br />
        The name Tarneeb is Arabic for &quot; trump &quot; ,<br />
        which is a distinct characteristic of trick-taking card games.<br />
    </p>

    <h2>Players and Cards  </h2>
    <p>
        Tarneeb is played by 4(players) Each pair of players are partners  <br />
        and are facing each other. <br />
        A standard international 52-card pack is used, <br />
        the cards in each suit ranking from high to low: A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2. <br />
    </p>

    <h2>Deal </h2>
    <p>
        The first dealer is chosen at random. <br />
        Each player is dealt 13 cards each. After the first dealer make their deal <br />
        the next turn to deal passes to the right. The cards are shuffled and cut, <br />
        and are all dealt out, one at a time so that everyone has 13 cards.<br />

    </p>

    <h3>Bidding</h3>
    <p>
        Bids begin with the player to the right of the dealer and continues counter-clockwise.<br />
        Each player has 1 opportunity to bid and can choose to match or raise the highest bid. <br />
        If all four players pass on their first turn to speak, the hand is thrown in, <br />
        and the cards are shuffled and redealt by the same dealer. <br />
        Bids must be of 7 tricks or more to be valid.<br />
        The winning bidder can set the Tarneeb (trump) suit for the round.<br />
        Each bid can be Pass or Bid and the bid consists of number of tricks and the trump suit or no-trump. <br />
    </p>


    <h3> Trick and trump suit </h3>
    <p>
        The individual tricks are split across multiple rounds. <br />
        The dealer begins the first trick by playing a card, therefore leading the trick. <br />
        Other players then attempt to win the trick by playing cards, with some players <br />
        requiring to follow suit. A player can win by playing a card of a higher value, <br />
        with the same suit. If a player does not have a card from the same suit, <br />
        they must still play a card of their choosing, but forfeit the round.<br />
        The trump suits are determined either by a draw from the remaining cards,<br />
        or through bidding. The trump suit becomes a winning suit during the game, <br />
        and adds a layer of strategy to the game, since these mitigate the advantage of the players leading the trick.<br />
        The winner of one trick will lead the next trick. This process continues until all hands are emptied.<br />

        Each bid can be Pass or Bid and the bid consists of number of tricks and the trump suit or no-trump. <br />

        The number of tricks is defined by number 1,2,3... where 1 means 7 tricks and generally (number + 6)<br />

    </p>

    <h3> Our game play logic </h3>
    <p>
        In order to be winner a winner at Tarneeb you have to be good at bidding and score.
    </p>

    <h3> Players </h3>
    <p>
        The game is played by 4 players there are options to have computer players- </br>
        players are set up in a coordinal point fashion – north, south, east and west. </br>
        Cards are shuffled and distributed evenly amongst players each player gets 13 cards.</br>
    </p>

    <h3> Play </h3>
    <p>
        The player who won the bidding leads to the first trick, and thereafter </br>
        the winner of each trick leads to the next.</br>
        Play is counter-clockwise. Players must follow suit if able to. </br>
        Those unable to follow suit may play any card - either trump (tarneeb)</br>
        or discard a card of another suit (sakret).</br>
        Each trick is won by the highest trump in it, or by the highest</br>
        card of the suit led if it contains no trumps.
    </p>
    <h3>Scoring </h3>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>There are 13 tricks. </li>
        <li>The bidder’s team tries to take as many tricks as they bid. </li>
        <li>The match finishes if one team reached 31 (winner) or -31 (loser)</li>
        <li>
            When there are 4 cards (all players played the hand), </br>
            the trick is evaluated and won by one of the teams
        </li>
        <li>Winning all 13 tricks is called kaboot.
        <li>
            If the bid was less than 13, kaboot brings a bonus of 3 points, </br>
            so 16 points in total instead of 13.
        <li> In general, the player who wins the most tricks wins the game by score.</li>

    </ul>
